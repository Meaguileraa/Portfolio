                    Hi, I'm Marissa and I'm a Software Engineer based in San Francisco, CA. I received my 
                    Bachelors degree in Business from California State University, Chico and started my career 
                    in technical recruitment. Being in this field of work allowed me to speak to a lot of 
                    Software Engineers daily, which continuosly piqued my interest. This led to me deciding 
                    to make a career switch and pursue software engineering. In September 2020 I completed
                    Hackbright Academy's 12 week coding bootcamp where I learned a full-stack curriculum and 
                    the computer science fundamentals.</br>  
                </br>
                    As I transition into this new career, I am very eager to learn new technologies and 
                    am passionate about working on a team where the work I am doing is meaningful and impactufl. 
                    I enjoy building relationships with team members, collaborating cross-functionally, and overall 
                    bringing a positive attitude to the team. Aside from coding, I enjoy hiking, roller skating, 
                    and creating digital illustrations. I am a very creative person and am excited for my 
                    future in tech!

                            Start planning your next visit to any of the 62 National Parks. National Park Service Guide 
                            is a full-stack web application that allows a user to choose a National Park and view the 
                            activities available at that park to save to a bucket list. I utilized the National Park Service 
                            API to retreive the necessary data to provide park and activity information.
